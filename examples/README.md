# Examples

This directory contains sample assets for the template-print workflow:

- `Sample Template.pdf` – a single-page watermark you can duplicate and customize. Replace the text with your own branding using Preview or Acrobat before deploying.

Copy any production-ready templates into `/Users/Shared/PDFTemplates` (or whichever directory you pass via `--dir`). You can organise templates into subfolders; the CLI will only list the PDFs at the top level to keep the chooser succinct.
